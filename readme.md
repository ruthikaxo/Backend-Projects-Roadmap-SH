# 🗂️ Backend Explorations

Welcome to my personal collection of backend projects!  
This repository will serve as a hub for multiple small-to-medium scale projects that I build to explore different concepts in backend development, from CLI tools to web apps, automation scripts, and beyond.

## 📌 Project 1: Task Tracker CLI  

### 📖 Overview  
The **Task Tracker CLI** is a lightweight command-line tool to help manage tasks across multiple “trackers.”  
Each tracker is stored as a JSON file, and you can add, update, mark as done, or delete tasks — all directly from your terminal.  

### 📦 Installation  
Clone the repo and install in **editable mode**:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruthikaxo/Backend-Projects-Roadmap-SH.git
cd task-tracker
pip install -e .
```
